    <h2>• Blood Clots</h2>
    <p>
        Blood clots are clumps of blood that have changed from a liquid to a gel-like or semisolid state.
        While clotting is a necessary process that can prevent you from losing too much blood in certain instances, 
        when clots form inside your veins without a good reason and don’t dissolve naturally, they can be dangerous 
        and lead to serious medical conditions like stroke or pulmonary embolism. <br>
        <b>Symptoms</b> may include swelling, pain, redness, and shortness of breath. <br>
        <em>Treatment</em> often involves blood thinners or surgical intervention in critical cases.

    <h2>• Vascular Insufficiency</h2>
    <p>
        Vascular insufficiency occurs when blood flow through your veins is inadequate, usually due to weakened vein walls or valves. 
        This condition can lead to pain, varicose veins, and swelling, particularly in the legs. <br>
        It is often caused by prolonged sitting or standing, obesity, or heredity. In severe cases, it can result in skin ulcers and 
        deep vein thrombosis. <br>
        <em>Treatments</em> may include compression therapy, medications, or surgical repair of the veins.

    <h2>• Angina</h2>
    <p>
        Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn’t get enough oxygen-rich blood.
        It can feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain may also occur in shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. <br>
        <b>Stable angina</b> occurs during physical activity and goes away with rest, while <b>unstable angina</b> can occur at rest and be more severe. <br>
        Angina is often a symptom of coronary artery disease and should be taken seriously. Treatments include lifestyle changes, medication, or procedures 
        like angioplasty or bypass surgery.
