    Welcome to our educational website about the <b>human circulatory system</b> and our innovative robotic solution to common health issues. 
    This website was created as part of a school project, with the goal of researching, understanding, and proposing technology-based 
    solutions to real-world biological problems. <br><br>
    
    The circulatory system is essential for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and hormones throughout the body. It includes the heart, 
    blood vessels, and blood. In our project, we dive deep into how this system works, identify major medical conditions that can affect it, 
    and finally, design a robotic nanotechnology-based solution that could one day help save lives. <br><br>

    We hope you enjoy navigating through each section, from research and problems to our robot design. Thank you for visiting!
